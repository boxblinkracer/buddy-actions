# Ask OpenAI

This action allows you to ask OpenAI for a text answer based on a given prompt.

It requires an OpenAI API key, which you can get from https://www.openai.com.
If you want to use multiple of these actions, it's recommended to use a **workspace variable** in Buddy for the OpenAI key.

The result of the action is stored in a variable **OPENAI_ANSWER**, which can be used in upcoming actions inside your pipeline.
