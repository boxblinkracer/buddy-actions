# Usage

Once cloned, the custom actions will automatically appear in your **action list**.
You can use them in your pipelines just like any other action.

# Reliability

Please note, that I usually try to create high quality products.
However, I cannot guarantee that these actions will always work as expected.

In this case you might want to create your custom actions based on these examples.

There will be no guarantee, reliability or high priority support for these actions.
