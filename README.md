This repository contains ready to use **custom actions** for [Buddy](https://buddy.works) that will help you automate pipeline with custom workflows and actions.

If you want to learn more about building your custom actions, please see this page: https://buddy.works/docs/pipelines/custom-actions

# Installation

Clone this repository in your Buddy workspace.

# Usage

Once cloned, the custom actions will automatically appear in your **action list**.
You can use them in your pipelines just like any other action.

# Reliability

Please note, that I usually try to create high quality products.
However, I cannot guarantee that these actions will always work as expected.

In this case you might want to create your custom actions based on these examples.

There will be no guarantee, reliability or high priority support for these actions.
